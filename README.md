There are 2 files:
  1. apss.py: this file will allow user to choose parameters.
  2. apss_optim.py: this file has the parameters adapted to my needs and the code is optimized to be 3x faster than 1.

For all the details about APSS see:
Guennebaud and Gross, 'Algebraic Point Set Surfaces', Siggraph 2007, and Guennebaud et al., 'Dynamic Sampling and Rendering of APSS', Eurographics 2008
